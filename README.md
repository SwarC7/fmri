Python requirements:3.9.6
U can proceed to install the libraries and dependencies from the requirements.txt by doing pip install -r requirements.txt
 
the codebase takes in a FC matrix input (we have tested on a rest fc matrix taken from hcp dataset- present in the zip file as .npy file)
the codebase tells u different network metrices like no of hubs identified, no of communities, density, no of brain regions(vertices), no of edges, small worldness index and other diff network metrics. 
 
the code also outputs a brain network graph image which consists of the different hubs identified along with communities
